                        <p>The Institute Archives and Special Collections (IASC) at MIT Libraries collects, preserves, and makes available digital material as well as paper and other analog formats. As the majority of the Institute’s work continues to be created digitally, the Institute Archives’ mission to collect and preserve its legacy will be met increasingly through digital archives collections. This Digital Transfer Tool provides the ability to transfer digital collections from Institute offices and from donors of personal papers to the MIT Library's Institute Archvies and Special Collections.</p>

                        <p>The Institute Archives and Special Collections (IASC) is interested in records that are generated or received by the various administrative and academic offices of the Institute in the conduct of their business, as well as teaching materials, research materials, correspondence with colleagues or professional organizations, committee files, financial records (summary level, budgets), and annual reports, just to name a few. However, the IASC only collects inactive material; If you are actively using the records, then they are not ready to be donated to the Archives.</p>
