                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

                    <p>A login to the Electronic Records Submission Tool is granted upon
                        approval of a Submission Agreement. The IASC staff will
                        send you an email when it has been activated. A Submission Agreement can be
                        completed <a th:href="@{/SubmitRequest}">here</a>.</p>

                    <h4>What kind of records can I send?</h4>

                    <p>
                        The IASC only accepts electronic records
                        (computer files) of permanent retention. These are generally records of
                        historical, administrative, or legal value and should be transferred to the
                        Archives for preservation. More information can be found
                    </p>

                    <h4>What are permanent records?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Permanent records are those kept for their historical, administrative, or legal value to
                        the university. They are designated as having "permanent" retention schedules. The university&#39;s
                        retention schedules are available.
                        If you have questions determining whether a record is permanent, contact the IASC
                        Staff <a th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${staff_email})}">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>My electronic records are on a CD/DVD (etc.). Do I use this tool to transfer to archives?</h4>

                    <p>
                        For permanent electronic records on media, follow procedures for
                        paper transfer. Alternatively, you could transfer the files from the media using this tool. In this
                        case, the
                        archives would not need the media.
                    </p>

                    <h4>I have multiple folders and files to send. How do I transfer them?</h4>

                    <p>
                        If the folders aren&#39;t important, then you can just select
                        the files as done for a regular transfer. In the situation
                        where the folder structure (ie. hierarchy) is important,
                        the transfer can be made in two ways. One method is to
                        create
                        a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Zip-File">zip
                        file</a>. The zip file can then be transferred to us using
                        ERST. The second method is to put the folders on external
                        media such as a flash drive, external hard drive or
                        optical media (CD or DVD). This media can then be dropped
                        off at the archives in Conrad Hall. If you need media,
                        please contact us at <span th:text="${org.phone}"></span>
                        or <a th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">email</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Do I need to create a Submission Agreement every time I want to send electronic records?</h4>

                    <p>
                        No, a Submission Agreement need only be created once per office.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Where do I enter an inventory?</h4>

                    <p>The website automatically creates an inventory from the
                        files selected for transfer. An email containing this list is sent to both the
                        IASC and to the sender. The user can also create an inventory
                        list and include as part of the file selection for transfer. Please label the file as "inventory."</p>

                    <h4>What are access restrictions?</h4>

                    <p>The records transferred should be free of any restrictions
                        for viewing by university employees or the public. If some records need to be
                        restricted from viewing, please note the restrictions on the transmittal form
                        when the records are transferred. Restrictions could be due confidentiality
                        information. If you have further questions, contact the <a th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">University
                            Archives staff</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Can I send records with a retention period?</h4>

                    <p>The University only accepts electronic records of "permanent
                        retention." For guidance on electronic records with a retention period,
                        contact the <a th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">IASC staff</a>.</p>

                    <h4>What if I need to add another user to send records?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Additional users can be added to an approved Submission Agreement for an office. Please contact the <a
                            th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">IASC staff</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>I need to change the head of department (or other field) on my approved Submission Agreement. What do I
                        do?</h4>

                    <p>
                        If you need to change information in your approved Submission Agreement, send an <a
                            th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">email</a> with your Office/Department Name (registered in
                        the Electronic Records Submission Tool), the field name that has new content and the new content.
                    </p>

                    <h4>I accidently sent an incomplete transfer request. I have more files to send. What should I do?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Send another transfer request with the missing files. Then either
                        email the <a th:href="@{mailto:{se}(se=${org.email})}">IASC</a> to let
                        them know, or you can also add a comment to this affect in the
                        transfer request description/comments box explaining the situation. We&#39;ll link the two requests in
                        our collection management system and put the downloaded files together.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How do I report a problem or bug or get more help?</h4>

                    <p>
                        If you are having a problem that can&#39;t be answered by the Help or FAQ or have found a possible
